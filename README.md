# Pokemon-Team-Maker
This project will give you a team of 6 pokemon based on inputs about your personality and lifestyle.

## API Data Pulls
This document shows how I connected to the Pokebase API and grabbed the pokedex entries and pokemon types.

## Data Preprocessing
This document shows how I reformatted the API data pulls, from one line per pokedex entry and one line per pokemon type, to one line per pokemon, with all entries and types.
