    "I reviewed the Descriptions of the 6 pokemon, Morelull is a little mushroom pokemon that talks about spores, glow, trees, and dark places. Not bad at all. Vanillish is an ice cream cone, so it uses the words 'freeze' and 'ice' a lot. Not a great fit. I really like Altaria, a dragon with wings made of clouds. It references the words 'soprano', 'clouds', ' wings','sky', and 'cotton'. Even though I like this pokemon, I'm not sure its a great fit. Grimmsnarl is a hairy, buff goblin, so it talks about 'muscles', hair', 'fibers'. Not a great fit for bag of words, but I could see the muscles being close to the 'gym' that I input in something like GloVe or BERT. Mabosstiff is a mastiff that has the word 'children' and 'family' so it isn't too surprising to see it here considering I used the word 'family' in my inputs. Reshiram is a weather dragon, so 'atmosphere', 'heat', 'weather', and 'fire' all show up. I'd say its a medium fit."

It has the words 'toxic', 'poisonous', 'petals', and 'cave'. This is just bag of words, so it really shouldn't be able to make these kinds of personality insinuations. Huntail is similar to an eel, with words like 'depths', 'ocean', 'snake', 'prey', and 'tail'. I don't think this is a great fit. Sinistcha is a matcha tea set, so that one isn't that confounding personality-wise, but I didn't put the word 'tea' in my inputs. I don't think TD-IDF was the way to go here."

    "This one was a difficult one to piece together, since I haven't used GloVe before. Snorunt is like a little icy cone. lots of 'snow', 'harmony', 'leaves', and 'prosper'. Snorunt doesn't have as much ice reference to the cold as I was expecting. Swablu again, I think that might just be my spirit pokemon at this point. Bellossom doesn't suprise me at all, its like a little grassy hula dancer. It references 'petals', 'sunlight', 'dance', and 'warm'. Since this isn't bag of words, and GloVe can make text connections through mathematical distances, this feels like a great fit for what I put in. Luvdisc is a heart shaped fish, talking about 'coral', 'love', and 'seas'. Another decent fit. Torterra, another favorite of mine, is a big turtle with a tree growing out of its back. 'back', 'ground', 'forests' all show up a few times, so another decent fit. Finally Sandile, a little desert crocodile, talking about 'sand', 'desert', and 'sun'. Not amazing, but not bad. So far this is up there with some good fits."

    "This was the most exciting one to implement since I've never used BERT before. Bulbasaur is a grass dinosaur with a big bulb growing out of its back, so we are looking at 'bulb', 'seed', 'back', and 'birth'. This one isn't bad considering all the green forestry imagery I fed the machine. Abomasnow is the abominable snowman, 'snow flowers', 'blizzard', 'mountain', not good, but not the worst one I've been given. Tropius is like a long necked dinosaur that grows bananas on its body. 'Fruit', 'leaves', and 'tropic' are all here, so I think this is a good fit. I'm not sure about Beautifly, it mentions 'aggressive' several times, along with 'nectar' and 'pollen'. Good for the forest imagery I gave it, but there must be some calmer forest pokemon that would be a better fit. Appletun looks like a dragon made from an apple pie, it talks about 'nectar', 'sweet', and 'scent'. Not bad at all. Skrelp, I keep getting poison types and I don't appreciate it. It looks like a leafy seadragon and talks about 'seaweed', and 'kelp' primarily. Not a bad recommendation at all."
